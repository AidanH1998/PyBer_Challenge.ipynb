## Overview ##

 The overview of the project is to look at the City Type Drivers and what they have to offer for their drivers. Drivers in Urban settings get more trips compared to drivers in suburban and rural areas, that is because the setting of Urban Cities is more compact compared to the other two. Although Urban Drivers get more trip their Average Fare Cost is lower compared to Suburban and Rural Driver, and that is because there are less drivers in Urban and Suburban areas. The points that are conducted are focusing on:
 
  * Total Drivers by City Type
  * Total Rider by City Type
  * Total Fares by Drives in City Type
  * Total Fare Cost Per Month
  * Time of Trips by City Types
