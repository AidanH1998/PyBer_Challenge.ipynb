## Overview ##

 The overview of the project is to look at the City Type Drivers and what they have to offer for their drivers. Drivers in Urban settings get more trips compared to drivers in suburban and rural areas, that is because the setting of Urban Cities is more compact compared to the other two. Although Urban Drivers get more trip their Average Fare Cost is lower compared to Suburban and Rural Driver, and that is because there are less drivers in Urban and Suburban areas. The points that are conducted are focusing on:
 
  * Total Drivers by City Type
  * Total Rider by City Type
  * Total Fares by Drives in City Type
  * Total Fare Cost Per Month
  * Time of Trips by City Types

###How many drivers are in the different city types?###

In the Rural area there are less driver because buildings are far from eachother. Suburban Is medium size drivers meaning that there is more drivers because the distance of locations are closer than rural areas. And the most drivers are in urban areas because the population is higher and the distance of locations are closer.

###What are the fares?###

The fare depend on distance and location, the further the distance the higher the fare. Location matters too becausein urban area the distance of locations are closer so the fare is lower because the distance is lower, but drivers get more also based on time and with traffic the time is longer. 

###Location###

Rural areas get less trips because less people use drivers in country sides. The Urban areas are the opposite because the drivers have a higher population meaning higher customers, usually when you order a driver, you are too lazy to take the public transportation system. Suburban area are in between urban and rural, they have less customers than urban drivers, but they still get more trips than rural driver.
